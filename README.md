# Sales-Data-Analysis-SQL & Power Bi
##  Project Title: Sales Performance and Trend Analysis
### Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze sales data to understand performance trends, identify key revenue drivers, and uncover actionable insights for improving sales strategies. This analysis focused on sales volume, revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance across different regions and time periods.

### Data Source
Kaggle: Publicly available sales dataset from Kaggle, containing details of orders, customers, products, regions, and revenue.

### Tools & Technologies Used
* SQL: Data Cleaning, Preparation, and Advanced Analysis
* Power BI: Visualization and Dashboard Development

### Key Metrics & KPIs
* Total Sales and Revenue Trends
* Top-Selling Products
* Sales by Region and Customer Segments
* Customer Retention and Repeat Purchases
* Monthly and Quarterly Performance

### Insights & Findings
* California overwhelmingly dominates sales, accounting for over 63% of total revenue. Washington is a distant second, with other states trailing far behind.
* Chairs and Phones are the highest revenue drivers, indicating strong demand for office furniture and communication equipment.
* Copiers, while not the top in sales, deliver the highest profit, suggesting high margins in this segment
* Bookcases and Machines are loss leaders, possibly due to high costs or discounting. Tables, despite high sales, have low profit, indicating margin pressure.
* A few high-ticket items (like copiers and executive chairs) contribute disproportionately to revenue.
* A small number of customers are responsible for a significant share of sales, highlighting the importance of key accounts

### Outcome & Impact
* This project demonstrates my ability to:
* Clean, transform, and analyze sales datasets using SQL
* Build visually compelling dashboards in Power BI
* Translate data findings into actionable insights for business growth
